Tools
==================

This section briefly describes some tools that can be useful to start
developing with Python. The tools presented hereiafter are somehow
regrouped according to a couple of criteria.

Notebooks or scripts?
--------------------------------

There are two main approaches to work with Python. One approach relies
on editing some ASCII files, with the extention `.py`, that contain a
series of instruction in the Python language. The istructions are
interpreted in sequential order, as they appear in the file. These are
the so called **Python Scripts**. Some lines can be skipped whenever
marked as comments.

The other approach relies on the use of Python Notebooks: Python
Notebooks are interactive web pages (because they can be opened with a
web browser) that contains diverse kind of cell. There are two main
types of cells: some cells contain Python code and plots; other cells
can contain formatted instruction and descriptions of what is done in
the code cells.

Both the approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Notebooks are
great for demonstration purposes and for teaching. For more complex
development task, where versioning and debugging are key factors,
script can be a better solution.

First of all, one can distinguish between tools made for working with
Python Notebooks or Python Scripts (actually, some of the tools
presented here allow to work with both Python Scripts and Python
Notebooks).
